# FaceMaskDetection
This project is based on Image processing(OpenCv) and Machine learning to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

Here, OpenCV is used to load image using python and convert it into array.
# steps

(1) Detect Face using HarcascadeFile.

(2)Collect Data of With Mask and Without Mask using face detection.

(3)Create a model using Machine learning.
(Here Classification SVM technique has used).

(4)Evaluating the model.

(5)Launching the model.
